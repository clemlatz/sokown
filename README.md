## In-universe intro

Traveling through space was once long, dangerous, and especially very expensive. But everything changed in 2019 with the
discovery of sokown, the « crimson gold », a miraculous fuel that put Mars less than a week's journey from Earth.

Today, space freighters crisscross the solar system, their holds full of precious goods, and The Sokown Company needs
brave pilots to guide them to their destination.

Does the void of space frighten you? Don't worry, all our spaceships are remote controlled, and you can pilot them from
the comfort of your home. All you need to join the adventure is a phone connected to the internet.

## Guiding design principles

Sokown is a game that :

- must remain fun even if played for no more than 15/20 minutes a day
- must be financed, if need be, solely by its community on the principle of voluntary donation
- must not offer paid features that give players a gameplay advantage
- must not implement addictive features

## Universe physics

- **Space is in two dimensions :** positions are expressed with a two coordinates system (x and y)
- **Gravity** **does not affect or help** **space travel** : ships can travel in straight lines without having to care (
  and without the ability to use) other bodies gravity.
- **There is no inertia** (yet) : ships only move when thrust is enabled and instantly stop when thrust is disabled
- **Time is the same as ours** : ****same speed, same current date
